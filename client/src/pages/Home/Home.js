          La Mama Care is focused on a mother’s holistic wellbeing immediately
          following childbirth. Started by three mamas who know firsthand how
          life-changing the first few days, weeks, and months can be, La Mama
          Care was conceived with parents from all walks of life in mind.
          Whether it is a first time mom or one who already has little ones at
          home, one who is breast or bottle feeding, is recovering from a
          cesarean birth or rocked a home birth, she is a superhero who deserves
          to feel nourished, supported, and strengthened during the postpartum
          period.

              11 to 20% of women who give birth have postpartum depression

              receive professional treatment.

            Mamas still need quite a bit of care after giving birth, but too
            often, the mama’s needs get put on the backburner while focusing on
            their newest addition.
