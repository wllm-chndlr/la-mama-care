          <strong>Even superheroes need support.</strong>
          <br />
          La Mama Care is focused on a mother’s holistic wellbeing immediately
          following childbirth. Started by three mamas who know firsthand how
          life-changing the first few days, weeks, and months can be, La Mama
          Care was conceived with parents from all walks of life in mind.
          Whether it is a first time mom or one who already has little ones at
          home, one who is breast or bottle feeding, is recovering from a
          cesarean birth or rocked a home birth, she is a superhero who deserves
          to feel nourished, supported, and strengthened during the postpartum
          period.

          <strong>The facts</strong>
          <br />
          Each year in the United States: 
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>11 to 20% of women who give birth have
            postpartum depression symptoms, yet only 15% of women with postpartum
            depression ever receive professional treatment.</li>
            <li>More than 600 women die of pregnancy-related causes.</li>
            <li>65,000 women will have severe pregnancy complications.</li>

          Bottom line: mamas still need quite a bit of care after giving birth,
          but too often, the mama’s needs get put on the backburner while
          focusing on their newest addition.

          practical essentials, our kits are intended to surround the mother
          with must-have items and helpful information to help navigate the
          critical 4th trimester. In addition, we use a unique approach to bring
          together the mom’s support system to ensure everyone is working
          together to provide the comfort and encouragement the mom needs.
